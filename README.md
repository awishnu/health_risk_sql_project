# ðŸ©º Health Risk Analysis using SQL

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project explores global health risk data to analyze obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption trends using SQL.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- MySQL Server
- CSV Dataset (from [source name])
- GitHub for portfolio hosting

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Identify regional patterns in obesity and lifestyle diseases.
- Measure correlation between alcohol use, smoking, and obesity.
- Practice SQL aggregation, joins, and subqueries.

## ðŸ§® Key SQL Techniques
- `JOIN` and `GROUP BY`
- `CTE` (Common Table Expressions)
- Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`)
- Subqueries
- Aggregate Functions (`AVG`, `COUNT`, `SUM`)

## ðŸ“Š Example Query
```sql
SELECT region, 
       ROUND(AVG(obesity_rate), 2) AS avg_obesity, 
       ROUND(AVG(smoking_rate), 2) AS avg_smoking
FROM health_data
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY avg_obesity DESC;
