# ðŸ©º Health Risk Analysis (SQL Portfolio Project)

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project explores lifestyle and health risk relationships using SQL in MySQL Workbench.  
Dataset: *Lifestyle and Health Risk Prediction (Synthetic Dataset)*

## ðŸ§± Database Setup
- Created a database `health_risk`
- Defined schema with fields: age, weight, height, exercise, sleep, sugar_intake, smoking, alcohol, married, profession, bmi, health_risk

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Standardized text inputs (e.g., lowercase)
- Checked for nulls and invalid BMI/age values
- Created cleaned table `health_data_clean`

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Highlights
- % of population with **high health risk**
- Impact of **exercise levels** on health risk
- Combined effect of **smoking and alcohol**
- **BMI category** correlation with health risk
- Professions with **highest risk levels**

## ðŸ§  Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- GitHub for portfolio documentation

## ðŸ“Ž Insights
- People with **low exercise** show higher health risk.
- **Obese** group has the highest high-risk percentage.
- **Smoking + alcohol** combination drastically increases risk.
